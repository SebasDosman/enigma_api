# Spring Boot Microservices Practice
This repository contains a practice project for Spring Boot with a microservices architecture. It consists of three different services orchestrated by a fourth service using RestTemplate technology.

## Services
1. **Service 1**: Enigma Step One
2. **Service 2**: Enigma Step Two
3. **Service 3**: Enigma Step Three
4. **Orchestrator Service**: This service uses RestTemplate to orchestrate the other three services.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Each service has its own directory and can be run independently.

## Running the Services
Each service can be started by navigating to its directory and running the appropriate command. The orchestrator service should be started last, as it depends on the other services.
